    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon almond or vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup seedless raspberry jam</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl using a whisk.</li>
        <li>Beat white sugar and butter together with an electric mixer on high in a bowl until light and fluffy; add egg and almond extract. Beat until well blended.</li>
        <li>Gradually beat flour mixture into sugar-butter mixture until dough is soft. Divide dough into 2 equal balls and wrap each portion in plastic wrap. Chill dough in refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Roll 1 dough ball into a 1/8-inch thick rectangle on a lightly floured surface; cut into 32 cookies using a square, star, or circular cookie cutter. Repeat with the second dough ball. Cut out the center of 32 cookies using a 1-inch square cookie cutter. Arrange all 64 cookies on the prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Cool on pans for 5 minutes before transferring cookies to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Spread about 1/2 teaspoon raspberry jam into the center of each whole cookie. Sprinkle the cut-out cookies with confectioners' sugar; place 1 cut-out cookie atop each raspberry jam-topped cookie.</li>
    </ol>
